**A note on office hours:**  I almost always receive unannounced walk-ins to my office, even if my door is closed.  So in addition to email, you may just knock and see if I’m available.  I will be in my office Tuesdays and Thursdays, and Friday afternoons this semester.  At other times, I will be at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and unavailable for office appointments.

**Campus Civility Statement**
Civility is genuine respect and regard for others: politeness, consideration, tact, good manners, graciousness, cordiality, affability, amiability and courteousness. Civility enhances academic freedom and integrity, and is a prerequisite to the free exchange of ideas and knowledge in the learning community. Our community consists of students, faculty, staff, alumni, and campus visitors. Community members affect each other’s well-being and have a shared interest in creating and sustaining an environment where all community members and their points of view are valued and respected. Affirming the value of each member of the university community, the campus asks that all its members adhere to the principles of civility and community adopted by the campus: http://civility.utk.edu/.

“An essential feature of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville is a commitment to maintaining an atmosphere of intellectual integrity and academic honesty. As a student of the university, I pledge that I will neither knowingly give nor receive any inappropriate assistance in academic work, thus affirming my own personal commitment to honor and integrity.”

Students are responsible for the information in Hilltopics http://dos.utk.edu/hilltopics/ regarding the policies and procedures about plagiarism and other forms of student misconduct.

**Disabilities that Constrain Learning**
“Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS) at 865-974-6087 in 2227 Dunford Hall to document their eligibility for services. ODS will work with students and faculty to coordinate reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities.”
